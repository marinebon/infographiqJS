# Changes in Infographiq 1.2 (November 14, 2022)

1. The Full Screen button is widened to match entries below it (better looking layout).
2. Tooltip now has a highlight behind the text, so that black text in a Tooltip can be seen against a black (or dark) background.
3. Tooltip now shows up in the right place, by the right icon, even when scrolling.
